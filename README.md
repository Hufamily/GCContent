GCCalc are a couple scripts I created to look at gc content, ag content, gc skew, and at skew in genomes from ncbi.
RepeatGC are a set of scripts I created to compare gc content in repeats and non repeats across species from softmasked genomes from ncbi, or from EarlGrey, the conda library for RepeatMasker.
